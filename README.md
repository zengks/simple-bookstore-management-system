# Simple Bookstore Management System

- The program builds up a simple library database by asking user to enter all details of each book to be stored. 

- All the book information will be updated and shown on a separate file in JSON format. 

- It also allows user to perform functions to the database such as deleting a book, viewing summary on a book and searching a book by its title, author or other related keywords.
